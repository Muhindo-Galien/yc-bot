Here is an overview of what happens during the YC program and the benefits you get as a YC founder. You can read more about why you should apply to YC here.\\nTHE YC PROGRAM\\nYC is a three month program. We now run YC four times a year, in the winter, spring, summer, and fall. Here’s what happens during the three months of YC:\\nThe Goal\\nThe overall goal of YC is to help startups really take off. They arrive at YC at all different stages. Some haven’t even started working yet, and others have been launched for a year or more. But whatever stage a startup is at when they arrive, our goal is to help them to be in dramatically better shape 3 months later.\\nFor most startups, better shape translates into two things: to have a better product with more users, and to have more options for raising money.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='For most startups, better shape translates into two things: to have a better product with more users, and to have more options for raising money.\\nStartups at all stages benefit from the intensity of YC. That’s probably the best word to describe the atmosphere. For 3 months, it’s all startup, all the time. Everyone around you—us, the other founders in your batch, the alumni, the speakers, the investors—wants to help your startup succeed. In that atmosphere it’s hard not to be highly motivated. And that kind of extraordinary motivation is what one needs to do something as difficult as starting a startup.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='Many founders describe the 11 weeks leading up to Demo Day as the most productive period in their lives. Though YC continues after the 3 month cycle, and the alumni community is an increasingly valuable resource, those 11 weeks are still the most important thing. You can’t make people something they’re not, but the right conditions can bring out the best in them. And since most people have way more potential than they realize, they’re often surprised by what they’re capable of.\\nFunding\\nYC invests $500,000 in every company on standard terms. Our $500K investment is made on 2 separate safes:\\nWe invest $125,000 on a post-money safe in return for 7% of your company (the “$125k safe”)\\nWe invest $375,000 on an uncapped safe with a Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) provision (the “MFN safe”)\\nGroups'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='We invest $125,000 on a post-money safe in return for 7% of your company (the “$125k safe”)\\nWe invest $375,000 on an uncapped safe with a Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) provision (the “MFN safe”)\\nGroups\\nDuring the batch, startups are sorted into 3 groups. Each group is led by YC partners who advise the founders in one-on-one and group office hours. Each group is split into sections (6-10 companies), so that founders get the benefit of an intimate setting within the larger batch.\\nOffice Hours\\nMuch of what takes place at YC happens during office hours. Partners host group office hours every two weeks and one-on-one office hours as often as founders want. What startups talk about at office hours depends on the stage of the company and where they are in the YC cycle.\\nBookface'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='Bookface\\nBookface is the platform founders use to connect to one another—imagine a combination of Facebook, Quora, and LinkedIn. Each founder has a profile and can tag themselves as an expert in any topic. If you have a question, need an introduction, or want to poll for knowledge, you can post the request to the forum on Bookface. The knowledge base of the YC community is both broad and deep—the community includes founders who are the world’s foremost experts in everything from security to community building to nuclear energy.\\nBatch Kickoff\\nIn the first few weeks of the batch we host a 3-day, in-person kickoff. The kickoff gives founders the opportunity to get to know each other, their group partners, and the YC team.\\nAlumni Talks'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='In the first few weeks of the batch we host a 3-day, in-person kickoff. The kickoff gives founders the opportunity to get to know each other, their group partners, and the YC team.\\nAlumni Talks\\nEvery week, we invite an eminent person from the startup world to speak. Most speakers are successful startup founders — the founders of Airbnb, Stripe, Doordash and Ginkgo Bioworks often come back to tell the inside story of what happened in the early days of their startups. Talks are strictly off the record to encourage candor, because the inside story of most startups is more colorful than the one presented later to the public.\\nPublic Launches\\nOnce a startup has something built that’s ready to launch, we help founders figure out how to present it to users and the press. We prepare founders for launches on community sites like Product Hunt and Hacker News, and for their first press pitches and interviews.\\nFirst Customers'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='First Customers\\nB2B and consumer companies often get their first 40-50 paying customers from the YC community. With that, you not only get first customers, you get the smartest early product feedback possible.\\nWeekly Meetups\\nThroughout the batch, we host weekly meetups in San Francisco. These events often feature special guests like the founders of YC and successful YC founders.\\nDemo Day\\nOn Demo Day, the latest batch of Y Combinator-funded founders present their companies to an audience of specially selected investors and press. We doubt there’s another occasion when such a large percentage of the top startup investors have their attention focused on the same thing.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='In the weeks following Demo Day we keep in close touch with the startups as they negotiate the fundraising maze, and help them decipher the real messages in investors’ sometimes deliberately ambiguous responses. Often we talk to the investors ourselves, to find out what they’re really thinking about a particular startup. Because YC-funded startups are a known quantity to investors and get introduced to enough of them to create serious price competition, companies tend to get higher valuations than they might otherwise.\\nBEYOND THE BATCH\\nYC doesn’t stop after the 3 month program ends. Here are some of the resources available to YC alumni as their companies grow.\\nADVICE\\nOngoing office hours\\nOffice hours don’t stop after the YC program. We have office hours year round, and startups from all previous cycles can book time whenever they want.\\nCOMMUNITY\\nAlumni community'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='Ongoing office hours\\nOffice hours don’t stop after the YC program. We have office hours year round, and startups from all previous cycles can book time whenever they want.\\nCOMMUNITY\\nAlumni community\\nToday the YC alumni community is probably the most powerful community in the startup world. It’s powerful not just because of its size, but also because its members have such a strong commitment to helping one another. A culture of helpfulness has been an important part of YC since the beginning, and founders know that if they ever come across a challenge they need help with, they not only have the partners at their disposal, they have 6,000+ domain experts they can call on.\\nAlumni Reunion\\nEach year, YC hosts a formal gathering of alumni. Exciting things happen when you bring founders together — ideas are exchanged, deals get made, problem solving happens amongst peers.\\nFounder Communities'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/about'}, page_content='Founder Communities\\nFounders have access to WhatsApp groups and Bookface channels that reach specific communities. There are lists for hardware, biotech, edtech, international, women founders, Black founders, Hispanic and Latino founders, and more.\\nAlumni Demo Day\\nActive YC founders get an early look at the YC companies in each batch at Alumni Demo Day.\\nDeals\\nEach YC company receives access to discounts and free accounts for over 100 products. Some of these are highly significant, including hundreds of thousands of dollars of free hosting for each company provided by major cloud hosting companies.\\nBRAND\\nCredibility\\nWhen one company in YC does well, the whole community benefits.

The safe was a simple and fast way to get that first money into the company, and the concept was that holders of safes were merely early investors in that future priced round. But early stage fundraising evolved in the years following the introduction of the original safe, and now startups are raising much larger amounts of money as a first “seed” round of financing. While safes are being used for these seed rounds, these rounds are really better considered as wholly separate financings, rather than “bridges” into later priced rounds.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/documents'}, page_content='In 2018 we released the “post-money” safe. By “post-money,” we mean that safe holder ownership is measured after (post) all the safe money is accounted for - which is its own round now - but still before (pre) the new money in the priced round that converts and dilutes the safes (usually the Series A, but sometimes Series Seed). The post-money safe has what we think is a huge advantage for both founders and investors - the ability to calculate immediately and precisely how much ownership of the company has been sold. It’s critically important for founders to understand how much dilution is caused by each safe they sell, just as it is fair for investors to know how much ownership of the company they have purchased.\\nThe safe has two fundamental features that are critically important for startups:'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/documents'}, page_content='The safe has two fundamental features that are critically important for startups:\\nIt allows for high resolution fundraising. Startups can close with an investor as soon as both parties are ready to sign and the investor is ready to wire money, instead of trying to coordinate a single close with all investors simultaneously. In fact, high resolution fundraising may be much easier now that both founders and investors have more certainty and transparency into what each side is giving and getting.\\nAs a flexible, one-document security without numerous terms to negotiate, safes save startups and investors money in legal fees and reduce the time spent negotiating the terms of the investment. Startups and investors will usually only have to negotiate one item: the valuation cap. Because a safe has no expiration or maturity date, there should be no time or money spent dealing with extending maturity dates, revising interest rates or the like.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/documents'}, page_content='Whether you are using the safe for the first time or are already familiar with safes, we recommend reviewing our Safe User Guide (geared primarily at US companies). The Safe User Guide explains how the safe converts, with sample calculations, an explanation of the pro rata side letter, and suggestions for best use.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/documents'}, page_content='While the safe may not be suitable for all financing situations, the terms are intended to be balanced, taking into account both the startup’s and the investors’ interests. There is a trade-off between simplicity and comprehensiveness, so while not every edge case is addressed, we believe the safe covers the most pertinent and common issues.

They have more data on what it takes to build a successful startup than any other early stage startup advisor. These partners read applications, interview companies, and mentor startups throughout the batch. You can access them in person, over email, and on Slack.\\n\\nInvestor network\\n\\nYC companies have raised $85 billion dollars from the best investors in the world. Our founders have access to the YC Investor Database which has profiles and reviews for more than 50,000 startup investors.\\n\\nPrivate social network only for founders\\n\\nYC founders get to benefit from the collective wisdom of over 9000 YC alumni. They can access these alums through Bookface, our private social network. We have a forum for asking questions to the community, a founder directory for finding specific people who can provide advice and intros, and a company directory for finding potential customers.\\n\\nExclusive deals\\n\\nYC founders have access to over 1000 deals from leading software companies. Every YC company gets free credits or significant discounts on hosting, banking, cap table management, back office, and much more. Companies report these deals to be worth in excess of $500,000.\\n\\nThe best written advice\\n\\nYC founders get to benefit from our collective experience funding 5000 companies across almost 20 years. We have extensive documentation for common questions about fundraising, go to market, sales, product market fit, mental health, hiring, and much more.\\n\\nNetworks to build your team\\n\\nThrough Work at a Startup and HN, we help our founders hire the small number of early engineers and other team members critical to finding product market fit.

Here is an overview of what happens during the YC program and the benefits you get as a YC founder. You can read more about why you should apply to YC here.\\n\\nTHE YC PROGRAM\\n\\nYC is a three month program. We now run YC four times a year, in the winter, spring, summer, and fall. Here’s what happens during the three months of YC:\\n\\nThe Goal\\n\\nThe overall goal of YC is to help startups really take off. They arrive at YC at all different stages. Some haven’t even started working yet, and others have been launched for a year or more. But whatever stage a startup is at when they arrive, our goal is to help them to be in dramatically better shape 3 months later.\\n\\nFor most startups, better shape translates into two things: to have a better product with more users, and to have more options for raising money.\\n\\nStartups at all stages benefit from the intensity of YC. That’s probably the best word to describe the atmosphere. For 3 months, it’s all startup, all the time. Everyone around you—us, the other founders in your batch, the alumni, the speakers, the investors—wants to help your startup succeed. In that atmosphere it’s hard not to be highly motivated. And that kind of extraordinary motivation is what one needs to do something as difficult as starting a startup.\\n\\nMany founders describe the 11 weeks leading up to Demo Day as the most productive period in their lives. Though YC continues after the 3 month cycle, and the alumni community is an increasingly valuable resource, those 11 weeks are still the most important thing. You can’t make people something they’re not, but the right conditions can bring out the best in them. And since most people have way more potential than they realize, they’re often surprised by what they’re capable of.\\n\\nFunding\\n\\nYC invests $500,000 in every company on standard terms. Our $500K investment is made on 2 separate safes:\\n\\nWe invest $125,000 on a post-money safe in return for 7% of your company (the “$125k safe”)\\n\\nWe invest $375,000 on an uncapped safe with a Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) provision (the “MFN safe”)\\n\\nGroups\\n\\nDuring the batch, startups are sorted into 3 groups. Each group is led by YC partners who advise the founders in one-on-one and group office hours. Each group is split into sections (6-10 companies), so that founders get the benefit of an intimate setting within the larger batch.\\n\\nOffice Hours\\n\\nMuch of what takes place at YC happens during office hours. Partners host group office hours every two weeks and one-on-one office hours as often as founders want. What startups talk about at office hours depends on the stage of the company and where they are in the YC cycle.\\n\\nBookface\\n\\nBookface is the platform founders use to connect to one another—imagine a combination of Facebook, Quora, and LinkedIn. Each founder has a profile and can tag themselves as an expert in any topic. If you have a question, need an introduction, or want to poll for knowledge, you can post the request to the forum on Bookface. The knowledge base of the YC community is both broad and deep—the community includes founders who are the world’s foremost experts in everything from security to community building to nuclear energy.\\n\\nBatch Kickoff\\n\\nIn the first few weeks of the batch we host a 3-day, in-person kickoff. The kickoff gives founders the opportunity to get to know each other, their group partners, and the YC team.\\n\\nAlumni Talks\\n\\nEvery week, we invite an eminent person from the startup world to speak. Most speakers are successful startup founders — the founders of Airbnb, Stripe, Doordash and Ginkgo Bioworks often come back to tell the inside story of what happened in the early days of their startups. Talks are strictly off the record to encourage candor, because the inside story of most startups is more colorful than the one presented later to the public.\\n\\nPublic Launches\\n\\nOnce a startup has something built that’s ready to launch, we help founders figure out how to present it to users and the press. We prepare founders for launches on community sites like Product Hunt and Hacker News, and for their first press pitches and interviews.\\n\\nFirst Customers\\n\\nB2B and consumer companies often get their first 40-50 paying customers from the YC community. With that, you not only get first customers, you get the smartest early product feedback possible.\\n\\nWeekly Meetups\\n\\nThroughout the batch, we host weekly meetups in San Francisco. These events often feature special guests like the founders of YC and successful YC founders.\\n\\nDemo Day\\n\\nOn Demo Day, the latest batch of Y Combinator-funded founders present their companies to an audience of specially selected investors and press. We doubt there’s another occasion when such a large percentage of the top startup investors have their attention focused on the same thing.\\n\\nIn the weeks following Demo Day we keep in close touch with the startups as they negotiate the fundraising maze, and help them decipher the real messages in investors’ sometimes deliberately ambiguous responses. Often we talk to the investors ourselves, to find out what they’re really thinking about a particular startup. Because YC-funded startups are a known quantity to investors and get introduced to enough of them to create serious price competition, companies tend to get higher valuations than they might otherwise.\\n\\nBEYOND THE BATCH\\n\\nYC doesn’t stop after the 3 month program ends. Here are some of the resources available to YC alumni as their companies grow.\\n\\nADVICE\\n\\nOngoing office hours\\n\\nOffice hours don’t stop after the YC program. We have office hours year round, and startups from all previous cycles can book time whenever they want.\\n\\nCOMMUNITY\\n\\nAlumni community\\n\\nToday the YC alumni community is probably the most powerful community in the startup world. It’s powerful not just because of its size, but also because its members have such a strong commitment to helping one another. A culture of helpfulness has been an important part of YC since the beginning, and founders know that if they ever come across a challenge they need help with, they not only have the partners at their disposal, they have 6,000+ domain experts they can call on.\\n\\nAlumni Reunion\\n\\nEach year, YC hosts a formal gathering of alumni. Exciting things happen when you bring founders together — ideas are exchanged, deals get made, problem solving happens amongst peers.\\n\\nFounder Communities\\n\\nFounders have access to WhatsApp groups and Bookface channels that reach specific communities. There are lists for hardware, biotech, edtech, international, women founders, Black founders, Hispanic and Latino founders, and more.\\n\\nAlumni Demo Day\\n\\nActive YC founders get an early look at the YC companies in each batch at Alumni Demo Day.\\n\\nDeals\\n\\nEach YC company receives access to discounts and free accounts for over 100 products. Some of these are highly significant, including hundreds of thousands of dollars of free hosting for each company provided by major cloud hosting companies.\\n\\nBRAND\\n\\nCredibility\\n\\nWhen one company in YC does well, the whole community benefits. Because YC has such a strong track record, early adopters, investors and press are often more willing to take a look at YC founders, even if they’re first time founders.\\n\\nCompany Directory\\n\\nYC companies are showcased in the YC Startup Directory. Our startups can be filtered and discovered by potential customers, investors, or hires.\\n\\nHIRING\\n\\nWork at a Startup\\n\\nWork at a Startup helps YC founders build their team — from first employees to VPs of product and operations. Thousands of jobseekers across hundreds of YC companies have landed roles through the platform and extended YC community.\\n\\nHacker News\\n\\nHN is a news aggregator where users can find and discuss the latest news and submit content on anything that gratifies one’s intellectual curiosity. YC alumni also post engineering, product, and design jobs on HN.\\n\\nFooter\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nYC Program\\n\\nStartup School\\n\\nWork at a Startup\\n\\nCo-Founder Matching\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nYC Blog\\n\\nContact\\n\\nPress\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nNotice at Collection\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nResources\\n\\nStartup Directory\\n\\nStartup Library\\n\\nInvestors\\n\\nSAFE\\n\\nHacker News\\n\\nLaunch YC\\n\\nYC Deals\\n\\nMake something people want.\\n\\nApply\\n\\nTwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYoutube\\n\\n© 2025 Y Combinator'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/internships'}, page_content=''), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/contact'}, page_content='Contact\\n\\nBefore contacting us, please check the Frequently Asked Questions.\\n\\nHere are contact emails for different parts of YC:\\n\\n\\n\\nFooter\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nYC Program\\n\\nStartup School\\n\\nWork at a Startup\\n\\nCo-Founder Matching\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nYC Blog\\n\\nContact\\n\\nPress\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nNotice at Collection\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nResources\\n\\nStartup Directory\\n\\nStartup Library\\n\\nInvestors\\n\\nSAFE\\n\\nHacker News\\n\\nLaunch YC\\n\\nYC Deals\\n\\nMake something people want.\\n\\nApply\\n\\nTwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYoutube\\n\\n© 2025 Y Combinator'), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/demoday'}, page_content=\"Demo Day\\n\\nTuesday, September 9th\\n\\nIf you are an investor and are attending demo day, access the demo day website here.\\n\\nOn Demo Day, Y Combinator's latest batch of startups present to an invite-only audience of approximately 1,500 investors and media.\\n\\nThe Demo Day will be held on Tuesday, September 9th.\\n\\nTo learn more, read our Demo Day FAQ.\\n\\nIf you are an investor and would like to attend demo day, you can apply here: https://events.ycombinator.com/summer25-demoday\\n\\nYou can also get a preview of the companies on the YC Startup Directory and Launch YC.\\n\\nFooter\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nYC Program\\n\\nStartup School\\n\\nWork at a Startup\\n\\nCo-Founder Matching\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nYC Blog\\n\\nContact\\n\\nPress\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nNotice at Collection\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nResources\\n\\nStartup Directory\\n\\nStartup Library\\n\\nInvestors\\n\\nSAFE\\n\\nHacker News\\n\\nLaunch YC\\n\\nYC Deals\\n\\nMake something people want.\\n\\nApply\\n\\nTwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYoutube\\n\\n© 2025 Y Combinator\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/startup-school'}, page_content='Recent Posts\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin us at Startup School 2024 in San Francisco - July 27\\n\\nApplications for Startup School 2024 are now open!\\n\\nStartup School\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\n\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\n7/8/2024\\n\\n\\n\\nWant to start a startup?

The safe was a simple and fast way to get that first money into the company, and the concept was that holders of safes were merely early investors in that future priced round. But early stage fundraising evolved in the years following the introduction of the original safe, and now startups are raising much larger amounts of money as a first “seed” round of financing. While safes are being used for these seed rounds, these rounds are really better considered as wholly separate financings, rather than “bridges” into later priced rounds.\\n\\nIn 2018 we released the “post-money” safe. By “post-money,” we mean that safe holder ownership is measured after (post) all the safe money is accounted for - which is its own round now - but still before (pre) the new money in the priced round that converts and dilutes the safes (usually the Series A, but sometimes Series Seed). The post-money safe has what we think is a huge advantage for both founders and investors - the ability to calculate immediately and precisely how much ownership of the company has been sold. It’s critically important for founders to understand how much dilution is caused by each safe they sell, just as it is fair for investors to know how much ownership of the company they have purchased.\\n\\nThe safe has two fundamental features that are critically important for startups:\\n\\nIt allows for high resolution fundraising. Startups can close with an investor as soon as both parties are ready to sign and the investor is ready to wire money, instead of trying to coordinate a single close with all investors simultaneously. In fact, high resolution fundraising may be much easier now that both founders and investors have more certainty and transparency into what each side is giving and getting.\\n\\nAs a flexible, one-document security without numerous terms to negotiate, safes save startups and investors money in legal fees and reduce the time spent negotiating the terms of the investment. Startups and investors will usually only have to negotiate one item: the valuation cap. Because a safe has no expiration or maturity date, there should be no time or money spent dealing with extending maturity dates, revising interest rates or the like.\\n\\nWhether you are using the safe for the first time or are already familiar with safes, we recommend reviewing our Safe User Guide (geared primarily at US companies). The Safe User Guide explains how the safe converts, with sample calculations, an explanation of the pro rata side letter, and suggestions for best use.\\n\\nWhile the safe may not be suitable for all financing situations, the terms are intended to be balanced, taking into account both the startup’s and the investors’ interests. There is a trade-off between simplicity and comprehensiveness, so while not every edge case is addressed, we believe the safe covers the most pertinent and common issues. Both parties are encouraged to have their lawyers review the safe if they want to, but we believe it provides a starting point that can be used in most situations, without modifications. We hold this belief because of our firsthand experience seeing and helping hundreds of companies fundraise every year, as well as the thoughtful feedback we received from the founders, investors, lawyers and accountants with whom we have shared drafts of every iteration of the safe.\\n\\nNeedless to say, YC does not assume responsibility for the contents of, or the consequence of using, any version of the safe or any other document found on our website. Before using any of these forms, you should consult with a lawyer licensed in the country where your company was formed.\\n\\nFooter\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nY Combinator\\n\\nPrograms\\n\\nYC Program\\n\\nStartup School\\n\\nWork at a Startup\\n\\nCo-Founder Matching\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nYC Blog\\n\\nContact\\n\\nPress\\n\\nPeople\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nNotice at Collection\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nResources\\n\\nStartup Directory\\n\\nStartup Library\\n\\nInvestors\\n\\nSAFE\\n\\nHacker News\\n\\nLaunch YC\\n\\nYC Deals\\n\\nMake something people want.\\n\\nApply\\n\\nTwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYoutube\\n\\n© 2025 Y Combinator')]\n",
